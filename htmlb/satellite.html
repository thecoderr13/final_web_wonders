            <p class="orbit_type_content">Low Earth Orbit satellites are moving at an altitude of roughly 160–1,500 kilometers above the Earth’s surface. They have a short orbital period, between 90 and 120 minutes, meaning they can travel around the planet up to 16 times a day. This makes them particularly well-suited to all types of remote sensing, high-resolution earth observation, and scientific research, as data can be acquired and transmitted rapidly.</p>

        <p class="orbit_type_content">A Medium Earth type of orbit is located between low Earth and geostationary orbits, typically at an altitude of about 5,000 to 20,000 kilometers. Positioning and navigation services, like GPS, extensively use MEO type of satellites. Recently, high-throughput satellite (HTS) MEO constellations have been put into operation to enable low-latency data communication to service providers, commercial and government organizations.</p>

        <p class="orbit_type_content">Spacecraft in geostationary Earth orbit are positioned 35,786 kilometers above Earth’s surface, precisely over the equator. Three evenly spaced machines in GEO can give nearly worldwide coverage thanks to the huge area they cover on Earth.Objects in GEO appear motionless from the ground because their orbital period is identical to Earth’s rotation — 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds. This allows a terrestrial antenna to always point toward the same device in space.</p>

        <p class="orbit_type_content">The Sun-synchronous orbit type of satellites goes from north to south across the polar regions at an altitude of 600 to 800 km above the Earth. The orbital inclination and altitude of SSO spacecraft are calibrated so that they always cross any given location at precisely the same local solar time. Thus, the lighting conditions are consistent for imaging, making this type of satellite ideal for earth observation and environmental monitoring.</p>

        <p class="orbit_type_content">The most frequent type of satellite transfer orbit is a geostationary one utilized to migrate from a transition orbit to GEO. Spacecraft are not always placed directly into their ultimate orbit when propelled from Earth into space by launch vehicles such as Falcon 9. Rockets carrying payload to GEO drop it off at transfer orbits, which are halfway points on the path to its final position. </p>

                Satellite navigation devices determine their location (longitude, latitude, and altitude/elevation) to high precision (within a few centimeters to meters) using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites. The system can be used for providing position, navigation or for tracking the position of something fitted with a receiver (satellite tracking).</p>
